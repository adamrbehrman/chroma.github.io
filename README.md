## Welcome to Chroma!

Chroma is an ear training app. We think it might be the best one.

Chroma is based off of synesthetic experiences. By matching each note to a color, you will build an association between the note and its color. Basically, you could learn perfect pitch through music and colors! 

### Features:
- Easy to get started. No manual, no complicated tests. Just you and the music.
- Trainer test to refine your skill as you go. Watch your score or reset it. Skip hard notes. Replay ones you missed.
- Full note-color customization. Pick your keyboard colors immediately or change them as you go.
- Revolutionary new pitch detection algorithm and immersive AR visualizer. Use this to experience any music as a synesthete would!

Synesthete see colors when they listen to music. If you want to experience this, let Chroma change the way you experience sound. Create your own practice routine. We recommend 10 minutes of daily practice with Chroma.

This app is being developed by researchers at Elon University studying the effects of sound-color on aural training.
